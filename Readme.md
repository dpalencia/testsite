# Personal Website - CIT 496P

This is a Jekyll website developed on an Ubuntu VM for the CIT 496P (Advanced Practicum In Information Technology) course at CSUN for the purpose of sharpening IT skills such as version control and working with an Ubuntu virtual machine.

## About Me

I am a senior at CSUN studying computer science, on my last semester. My professional experience includes web development for a small agency, and my academic experience includes developing mobile apps, data science, & machine learning. On my free time I like playing guitar, gaming, and stargazing.
